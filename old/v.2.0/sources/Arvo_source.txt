The initial drawing was made as Multiple master with Postscript contours, in Fontlab.

You can find Multiple master source in /Fontlab folder.
Drawing had been scaled  to Truetype UPM box. 2048 units.

Unfortunately gradually final files have distanced themselves from those files.
I have used TTX tools to manipulate intermediate Truetype (.ttf files)
And moreover corrected Truetype curves in VTT to be able to work on hints.

Release versions in late november 2010 were
Roman and italic v.104
Bold cuts (roman and italic): v.105 (corrected mac indesign activation problem, naming tables)

-----Vertical dimensions of fonts are (@2048 UPM | @1000 UPM)
Ascender 1556 | 760 
Caps 1516 | 740
Descender -471 | -230
xheight 1036 | 506

hhea dimensions are so far:
hhea Ascend 1968 | 961
hhea Descend -247 | 121
hhea linegap 55 | 27

Typo Asc 1556 | 760
Typodesc -471 | 230
Typolinegap 110 | 54
Winasc 1968 | 961
Windesc -506 | 247
(but there are some weird bugs on OSX with interlinear, i am puzzling with it)
